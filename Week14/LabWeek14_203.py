# Write a function that reads a column of numbers from a file,
# calculates the average, and writes the average to a file.



# Use recursion to generate a Collatz sequence from a user-specified positive number.

# The Collatz conjecture says that if you start from an integer greater than or equal to 1,
# then divide by 2 if the number is even,
# or triple the number and add 1 if the number is odd,
# then the sequence will end up at 1.



# (a) Without using a computer, predict the output of this code, given user input values of your choice.
# (b) What is the purpose of the function?
# (c) This code does not work if the initial input is "q".
#     Correct the code so that it handles this case correctly.
# (d) Check all of your work by running code.


# def main():
#     sum = 0
#          count = 0
#          x = input("Enter a number (q for quit) ")
#     while (x != "q"):
#         sum = sum + float(x)
#         count += 1
#         x = input("Enter a number (q for quit) ")
#     print ("Result: :", sum/count)
